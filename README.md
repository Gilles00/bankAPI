# bankAPI
This repo contains an API with simple banking functions. The user can create an account the details of which are stored on a database, and can deposit, withdraw, transfer money, issue loans or pay them back. Deposit, loans and account deletion require admin password approval (which is primed by registering the "admin" account). The database also keeps track of all transactions and can provide a list for every account.
